This program, developed by Ilhem Elheddi & Imane Madani, organizes registrations of student-athletes for regional university games in the central region. It uses a matrix structure of linked linear lists to represent registrations for up to 20 sports events. Universities and sports events, listed alphabetically, are stored in tables named "tabuniv" and "tabepreuve" respectively.          
Each university can enroll 0 to 15 athletes per event. Athlete data, including numbers, surnames, and first names, are stored in Linked List-like structures. The matrix "tabjru" holds pointers to athlete records for each event and university combination. If no athletes are registered, the corresponding element contains NULL.
